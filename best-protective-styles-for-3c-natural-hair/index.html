<p><strong>Best Protective Styles For 3C Natural Hair</strong>, This style is perfect for embracing your natural hair and keeping it protected and moisturized. Well, i decided to try other protective styles like buns (but they pulled on on my edges too much), twist outs (a bit better than buns, but there was too much manipulation every night), flat twists (these worked the best), and updos on stretched hair (liked these a lot). I have read so many different things that say that a bun is the most protective style to wear 3c/4a hair in but i find it�s just the opposite for me.</p>
