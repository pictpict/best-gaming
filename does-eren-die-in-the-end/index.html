<p><strong>Does Eren Die In The End</strong>, Since the anime is still being broadcast, his death hasn’t been shown in the anime series yet, but we have no doubt that it will appear towards the end of the anime’s final season, we just don’t know the exact episode number. Eren has officially died, and with his death comes the end of the titan power overall (saving all of those who were forcibly transformed in the penultimate chapter). However, that answer varies by the end of the manga, but that is out of the scope of our current discussion.</p>

<p>The key to this is the founder, ymir fritz. Well, the answer is both yes and no. Does eren die in ‘attack on titan’? Yes, because eren is afflicted by ymir’s curse, which dictates that a titan shifter can only survive for 13 years after inheriting their powers. Therefore, eren is technically dead in attack on titan, but he does not stay dead. Since the anime is still being broadcast, his death hasn’t been shown in the anime series yet, but we have no doubt that it will appear towards the end of the anime’s final season, we just don’t know the exact episode number.</p>
