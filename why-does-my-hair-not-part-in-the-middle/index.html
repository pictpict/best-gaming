<p>I have no idea why, but my hair is my hair and there�s nothing i can do about it at 28. Add more moisture to the middle of your hair (if that is the kinkiest section) so that you can ensure that it remains hydrated. While your hair is wet, apply a light hold heat protectant product, such as briogeo farewell frizz blow dry perfection heat protectant cream ($24). In more stubborn cases, you might consider having a body wave performed on the hair to add just a touch of wave to the hair to help mask the parting in back. Still, if you�re determined to pull off this look, you can try a modified center part of sorts by sectioning your hair just slightly off center. I believe there must be lots of microscopic fibers sticking out of the knit fabric that grab onto my hair strands like velcro.</p>
