<p><strong>What Hairstyle Do Guys Like Reddit</strong>, 1] you’re too cheap to get a real haircut, 2] you still live with mum who gives you your haircut, and 3] you have an awesome lego. Men forget that women generally like to run their fingers through a man�s hair. With male clients, barbers and stylists are often hesitant to offer up suggestions, so don�t be afraid to ask if the person who cuts your hair has ideas.if they suggests something, give it a try—remember, the person who cuts your hair is trained to give you the most flattering haircut possible, and they should be ready with suggestions if it looks like your style could use some.</p>

<p>I don’t like long hair swinging around on men or buns or ponytails idk why so maybe no long braids or dreads but short braids on the head i find that pretty sexy/ cute/masculine! I would have no problem buzzing my guys head, as long as he wouldn�t get mad at me if i messed up. I�m most attracted to men with really long hair, example this, though undercuts are sexy too. The idea that women with long hair are considered to be a more desirable mate in men’s eyes is supported by decades of examples from popular culture and evolutionary psychology.</p>

<p>Depends on the girl�s face, but i�m a big fan of various types of pixie cut/short hair. If i was choosing from your pics it would be 1. Current modern hairstyles such as the undercut and fades look great as well. You want to look polished and not unkempt. I like mohawks quite a bit, the hitler youth cut, shaggy/emo hair if it fits them, long if it�s well kept and again, fits them. However, one study suggests that short hair is associated with just different, but not worse, aspects of female attractiveness.</p>
