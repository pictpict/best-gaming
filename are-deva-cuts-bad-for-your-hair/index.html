Both ouidad and devacurl believe that shampooing can damage curly hair and needs to be minimized and ideally that those with curly hair seek out products without harmful chemicals. Doing a devacut on undefined, frizzy curls could negatively affect your results. I pretty much insist on having a curly haired hairdresser in general, as at least they understand my hair! The traditional haircut just doesn’t work, which is why the stylists at devachan knew they had to do something different. Such a hairstyle looks really sexy and sassy, it’s appropriate for girls and women of any age, and you can do many different hairstyles with the longer hair on top.</p>
