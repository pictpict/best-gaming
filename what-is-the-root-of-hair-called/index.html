<p>This part of the body dictates how straight or curly the hair is once it is formed. It is just beneath the skin and located in a small tube called the hair follicle. The cells of this region also elongate and bring about growth in the length of the root. The liver sinusoids are lined with two types of cell, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and phagocytic kupffer cells. But even a taproot is more complex than just a single structure.
