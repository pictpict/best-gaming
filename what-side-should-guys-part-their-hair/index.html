<p><strong>What Side Should Guys Part Their Hair</strong>, The side part works best with thicker hair, though it is possible to style with finer hair. But the truth is, how and what side you should part your hair really comes down to what direction your hair grows. I learned about this while listening to one of my favorite podcasts, radiolab (i’m a podcast junkie).</p>

The general consensus seems to be that parting on one’s left makes a person look competent and masculine, whereas parting on the right makes a person look warm and feminine.</p>
