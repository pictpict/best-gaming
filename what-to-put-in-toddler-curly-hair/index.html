<p>Well, just imagine trying to detangle a child’s hair, or better yet, a toddler’s hair! Mash a ripe avocado with a tablespoon of honey and two tablespoons of olive oil. Apple cider vinegar, milk, fenugreek seeds and hibiscus are all great natural treatments to have healthy curly hair. Again only wash a few times a week as curly hair tends to be dry. No matter your kid’s hair texture, a day spent at the beach, the playground, school or even at home, can tangle hair and leave it unmanageable, which could also lead to tons of tears…from both of you!.
