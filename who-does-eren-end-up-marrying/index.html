<p><strong>Who Does Eren End Up Marrying</strong>, He�s an outside context problem to anything future related if he isn�t technically part of the paths. For a long time, fans were almost certain that the main hero, eren jaeger, and his comrade mikasa ackerman would get together by the end of attack of titan.though it was obvious that mikasa had.

<p>But for historia, she didn’t hesitate to punch him back into reality and ended up saving eren from his own death wish as well as being chained. “it’s just going to be us, maybe we’ll meet new people, it will be good for you.” he was right. When it comes to attack on titan �s main trio, most fans have come to the conclusion that armin and mikasa are simply platonic best friends. Their will they or won�t they situation drew in viewers throughout the first few seasons.</p>

<p>The only reason people believe that will happen is because some readers see women as prizes to be won and since jean likes her, they expect them to end up together, even though they�ve barely interacted and mikasa has always been in love with eren. When it comes to attack on titan �s main trio, most fans have come to the conclusion that armin and mikasa are simply platonic best friends. Despite this, it is possible for eren and historia to marry — more out of duty and obligation than love. Yes, eren does love mikasa as she is definitely the most important woman in his life after his mother. As an ackerman but also as mikasa, her life revolves around eren. Today is friday, so he suggested earlier that they go out to have some fun.</p>
