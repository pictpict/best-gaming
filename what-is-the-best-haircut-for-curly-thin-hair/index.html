<p>Be sure to leave a lot of curls flouncing around the face; If you want to go a little longer, a shoulder length cut with a deep side part adds instant volume. A versus diametrix cut is a long diagonal angled cut which uses a cutting technique that reduces the bulkiness of your hair from the bottom. If you want to make your hair appear thicker without having to build a bunch of volume, consider a pixie cut like this one.</p>

<p>The bouancy of curls can also alter the look of your actual hair length. I am a professional who likes to feel young and sexy on my own time. One look and it’s easy to see why. If you are looking for perfect curls every time, brushed out barrel curls are a classic hairstyle for curly hair, especially if you have fine thin curly hair. On the otherhand, if your curls have become thinner or more brittle with age, the shaggy texture of this cut can mask a lot of that, which is why the wolf haircut is one of our favorite haircuts for thin curly hair.
